                    <p> Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like,
                        'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t.
                        ... uh .... And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments
                        that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Yeah. I did. Because
                        he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
                        people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
                        process. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys
                        like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ...
                        that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,
                        people. See where that goes.</p>

                        the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait!
                        Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we
                        all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't
                        look like you're having a lot of fun. And that was actually, you know, one
                        of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.
                        But I dare anyone to debate me on things.</p>

                <p> They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my
                        life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again,
                        bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you
                        know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! And therefore there's nothing in the
                        middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
                        slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
                        And it's just not an option. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
                        man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.</p>

                <p>I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately
                        around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the
                        view, Alex. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly

                        sure like the view, Alex. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because
                        that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself.  Take for
                        instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
                        plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
                        find that chapter in his silly book of lies.</p>
